Project Name: No Men’s Korprulu Sector

A paragraph briefly describing your project:

We have decided to work on a single-player game which would be commanding a spacecraft in the first-person view(looking out from the cockpit). We seek to integrate the nobility of the Protoss, brutality of the Zergs, and fortitude of the Terran into an adventurous journey with a controllable first-person view from the various different spacecraft. Through keyboard control, the user would be able to shift between three parallel positions within the window frame. This parallel line would be able to rotate as the user rotate the screen. Furthermore, “w” and “s” key will be able to control the speed of the spacecraft. The background(skybox) of this project would be a space sector, which contains many different planets and suns. There would also be randomly generated obstacles, such as asteroids and wreckages, which the user would have to avoid to prevent a collision. 

At ease commander, you are about to enter the beautiful space in the Korprulu Sector -  the center of the galaxy far away from the indoctrination of the United Earth Directorate. We have prepared various spacecraft awaiting your command: from a coarsely built Viking to a deadly Minotaur class Battlecruiser; from an invisible oracle to an invincible tempest of the golden armada. They are the crystalization of the most advanced technology in this galaxy. Nonetheless, you must pay attention to the asteroids and wreckages left behind from the battle of Char. Last but not least, always watch out for zergs roaming around the sector. You would never want to fxxk around with mutalisks and corrupters. 

En Taro Commander! For Terran Dominion!

In this project, we would use the following techniques to enhance user experience and emphasize the beauty and danger that hide underneath the silence space of the Korprulu Sector.
